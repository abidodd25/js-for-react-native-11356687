# Task One
The task one contains a JavaScript function called processArray which processes an array of numbers according to the following logic: if the number is even, it squares it; if it's odd, it multiplies it by 3. The function utilizes the map method to apply the logic to each element of the array.

# Usage
To use the processArray function, follow these steps:

Include the function in your JavaScript file or environment.
Call the processArray function with an array of numbers as its argument.
The function will return a new array with each number processed according to the defined logic.

# Task Two
Task Two contains a JavaScript function called formatArrayStrings which formats an array of strings based on another array of numbers. The function takes two parameters: an array of strings and an array of numbers. Each string in the input array is formatted to be either all uppercase or all lowercase based on whether the corresponding number in the second array is even or odd. The logic is applied using the map method.

# Usage
To use the formatArrayStrings function, follow these steps:

Include the function in your JavaScript file or environment.
Call the formatArrayStrings function with two arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers.
The function will return a new array where each string is formatted based on the logic described above.
